# Contributing

Any contributions are very welcome. 

All bug reports, suggestions, ideas, comments are very useful for the integrity and continual development of `flow-py-sdk`. All of those can be reported as issues [here](https://github.com/janezpodhostnik/flow-py-sdk/issues).

If you would like to contribute to the code, the best place to start is to run the [examples](./examples.md) locally. After that your environment will be set up for development.

If you don't have anything specific in mind but still want to contribute make sure to check any open issues.
